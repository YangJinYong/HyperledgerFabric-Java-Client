# Fabric-Java-Client(Work in progress :) )
A Java based fabric client.

The application will load a <b>connection profile </b>(/src/com/fabric/config/network-config.json) file and then it will be used by fabric java client to simplify the steps needed to setup and use the network. The connection profile has specific addresses and settings of network items.
A sample connection profile has been provided under directory /src/com/fabric/config/.
A detailed documenation on how to create a connection profile is availble at:
